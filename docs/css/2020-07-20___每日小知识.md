### 文本内容超出一行，超出部分截断显示...

```
<p class="truncate-text">If I exceed one line's width, I will be truncated.</p>
.truncate-text {
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  width: 200px;
}

```

overflow: hidden prevents the text from overflowing its dimensions (for a block, 100% width and auto height).
white-space: nowrap prevents the text from exceeding one line in height.
text-overflow: ellipsis makes it so that if the text exceeds its dimensions, it will end with an ellipsis.
width: 200px; ensures the element has a dimension, to know when to get ellipsis
Only works for single line elements.
